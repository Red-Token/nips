----------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines the ARK Payment Protocol using Nostr

### Extension to BIP21

This NIP introduces a new parameter to the BIP21 payment protocol.

arkpp:#npub#

`"arkpp", <npub>`

Where:

* `<npub>` represent the npub of the seller.

## Example

### Sunshine examples

Base Scenario consists of the following users.

- Alice, the star of the show, she owns one BTC.
- Bob, runs the teahouse, he owns one BTC.
- Carol, owns one BTC
- Dave, owns one BTC.
- Freddy, has one BTC onchain and wants to join the Ark.
- Eve, sells shoes in Wonderland.

#### Scenario 1 - Alice pays Bob for tea at the teahouse.

1. Bob presents Alice with a QR code containing a bitcoin url based on BIP 21 with ARKPP extension.
   `bitcoin://<onchainaddress>?amount=0.0001&label=<uid>&arkpp=<teahouse_npub>`

2. Alice scans the QR code and finds the arkpp variable in her arkpp wallet. She sends a ARKPP Payment Request to Bob.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6661,
      "tags": [
         'p': <teahouse_npub> 
      ],
      content: {
         payment_id: <payment_id> 
      },
   ]
   ```
3. Bob sends the payment offer.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6662,
      "tags": [
         'p': <alice_npub> 
      ],
      content: { 
         pubkey: <pubkey>
         amount: 30000
         arks: {
            include: [
               <ark1_pub>, <ark2_pub>
            ],
            exclude: [
               <ark3_pub>, <ark4_pub>
            ],
            included_only: true,
         },
         offer: {
            currency: "USD"
            items: [ 
               description: "Black Tea",
               quantity: 1,
               price: 3.0,
            ]
            vat: 5%,
         }
      },
   ]
   ```

4. Alice decodes the payment request and selects an ARK that matches, creates a transaction and sends it in a payment
   request to the ASP.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6663,
      "tags": [
         'I': <txid>,
         's': <spent_utxo>
         'e': <payment_offer_id>
         'p': <ark1_pub> 
      ],
      content: <base64 encoded transaction>,
   ]
   ```

      ```
      {
         input: [
            <alice_vutxo>
         ]
         output: [
            { amount: 99989900 , script: "A + S | A + dT" }   // Alice change
            { amount: 10000 , script: "B + S | B + dT" }      // Bobs payment
            { amount: 100 , script: "S" }                     // ARK fee
         ]
         signatures: [
            A
         ] 
      }
      ```
   
   5. The ASP checks the transaction that it's valid, signs it and sends out a transaction confirmation.

      ```
      [
         "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
         "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
         "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
         "kind": 6664,
         "tags": [
            'I': <txid>,
            's': <spent_utxo>
            'e': <payment_offer_id>
            'p': <alice_pubkey> 
         ],
         content: <base64 encoded transaction>,
      ]
      ```

      ```
      {
         input: [
            <alice_vutxo>
         ]
         output: [
            { amount: 99989900 , script: "A + S | A + dT" }   // Alice change
            { amount: 10000 , script: "B + S | B + dT" }      // Bobs payment
            { amount: 100 , script: "S" }                     // ARK fee
         ]
         signatures: [
            A, S
         ] 
      }
      ```

   
6. Bob sees the transaction and issues a payment confirmation.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6665,
      "tags": [
         'e': <payment_offer_id>
         'e': <transaction_confirmation_id>
         'p': <alice_pubkey> 
      ],
      content: {}
   ]
   ```

#### Scenario 2 - Freddy joins the Ark.

#### Scenario 3 - Clare exits 0.3 BTC from the Ark.

#### Scenario 4 - Alice buys a pair of shoes from Eve.

#### Scenario 5 - Wonderland Ark starts a new round financing it with the BTC.

#### Scenario 6 - Bob subscribes to a subscription service.

#### Scenario 7 - Clare buys an episode from the Wonderland Gazette for 1000 sats.

### Storm cloud examples

#### Scenario 1 - Queen of Hearts colludes with Royal ARK tries to scam Alice with a double spend, gets detected and license terminated, Alice is reimbursed.

### Dark pattern

#### Scenario 1 - A totally corrupt ARK with corrupt users that are created by the ARK with an intent to defraud.
