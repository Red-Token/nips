## Terminology

### Ark Service Provider

The Ark Service Provider provides ark services to its users. He maintains a nip01 community entry.

### Ark Insurance Provider

The Ark Insurance Provider provides insurance for Ark Users and Ark Service Providers

### Ark User

An Ark User is an entity that accepts or sends payments using the Ark protocol.

### Extension to BIP21

This NIP introduces a new parameter to the BIP21 payment protocol.

arkpp:#npub#

`"arkpp", <npub>`

Where:

* `<npub>` represent the npub of the seller.

## Events

#### ARK Request for Quotation Event

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6661,
      "tags": [
         'p': <teahouse_npub> 
      ],
      content: {
         qoutation_id: <payment_id> 
      },
   ]
   ```

#### ARK Quotation Event

The ARK Quotation Event is registered as `kind:6662`, this is sent to a user that has requested to pay something.

- the `p` tag is mandatory and is sent to the recipient.
- the `content` variable contains a json formated object that contains the quotation.

##### The Quotation

   ```json
{
  "content": {
    "pubkey":
    //<sdfsfsdf>
  }
}

   ```

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6662,
      "tags": [
         'p': <alice_npub> 
      ],
      content: { 
         pubkey: <pubkey>
         amount: 30000
         arks: {
            include: [
               <ark_pub>
            ],
            included_only: true,
         },
         offer: {
            currency: "USD"
            items: [ 
               description: "Black Tea",
               quantity: 1,
               price: 3.0,
            ]
            vat: 5%,
         }
      },
   ]
   ```

## Examples

### Abbreviations

- dT=100 = relative timelock of 100 blocks.
- T=1000 = absolute timelock of 1000 blocks.
- H = hashlock.
- A + B = locked by private key A and private key B.

### Sunshine examples

Base Scenario consists of the following users.

- Alice, the star of the show, she owns one BTC.
- Bob, runs the teahouse, he owns one BTC.
- Carol, owns one BTC
- Dave, owns one BTC.
- Freddy, has one BTC onchain and wants to join the Ark.
- Eve, sells shoes in Wonderland.

The following transactions are committed on-chain:

   ```
   {
      id: <ark_round_1_root>
      input: [
         <4BTC>
      ],
      output: [
         { amount: 400000000, script: "A + B + C + D + S | S + T=1000" }   
      ]
      signatures: [
         A, B, C, D, S
      ] 
   }
   ```

The following transactions are published in the relay:

   ```
   {
      id: <vtx1_hash>
      input: [
         <ark_round_1_root>:0   // Commited on chain
      ],
      output: [
         { amount: 200000000, script: "A + B + S | S + T=1000" }   // Alice + Bob
         { amount: 200000000, script: "C + D + S | S + T=1000" }   // Carol + Dave
      ]
      signatures: [
         A, B, C, D, S
      ] 
   }
   ```

   ```
   {
      id: <vtx2_hash>
      input: [
         <vtx1_hash>:0
      ],
      output: [
         { amount: 100000000, script: "A + S | A + dT=100" }   // Alice VUTXO
         { amount: 100000000, script: "B + S | B + dT=100" }   // Bob VUTXO
      ]
      signatures: [
         A, B, S
      ] 
   }
   ```

   ```
   {
      id: <vtx3_hash>
      input: [
         <vtx1_hash>:1
      ],
      output: [
         { amount: 100000000, script: "C + S | C + dT=100" }   // Carol VUTXO
         { amount: 100000000, script: "D + S | D + dT=100" }   // Dave VUTXO
      ]
      signatures: [
         C, D, S
      ] 
   }
   ```

#### Scenario 1 - Alice pays Bob for tea at the teahouse.

1. Bob presents Alice with a QR code containing a bitcoin url based on BIP 21 with ARKPP extension.
   `bitcoin://<onchainaddress>?amount=0.0001&label=<uid>&arkpp=<teahouse_npub>`

2. Alice scans the QR code and finds the arkpp variable in her arkpp wallet. She sends an ARKPP Payment Request to Bob.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6661,
      "tags": [
         'p': <teahouse_npub> 
      ],
      content: {
         payment_id: <payment_id> 
      },
   ]
   ```
3. Bob sends the payment offer.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6662,
      "tags": [
         'p': <alice_npub> 
      ],
      content: { 
         pubkey: <pubkey>
         amount: 30000
         arks: {
            include: [
               <ark_pub>
            ],
            included_only: true,
         },
         offer: {
            currency: "USD"
            items: [ 
               description: "Black Tea",
               quantity: 1,
               price: 3.0,
            ]
            vat: 5%,
         }
      },
   ]
   ```

4. Alice decodes the payment request and selects an ARK that matches, creates a transaction and sends it in a payment
   request to the ASP.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6663,
      "tags": [
         'I': <txid>,
         's': <spent_utxo>
         'e': <payment_offer_id>
         'p': <ark_pub> 
      ],
      content: <base64 encoded transaction>,
   ]
   ```

      ```
      {
         id: <vtx4_hash>
         input: [
            <vtx2_hash>:0
         ]
         output: [
            { amount: 99989900 , script: "A + S | A + dT" }   // Alice change
            { amount: 10000 , script: "B + S | B + dT" }      // Bobs payment
            { amount: 100 , script: "S" }                     // ARK fee
         ]
         signatures: [
            A
         ] 
      }
      ```

5. The ASP checks the transaction that it's valid, signs it and sends out a transaction confirmation.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6664,
      "tags": [
         'I': <txid>,
         's': <spent_utxo>
         'e': <payment_offer_id>
         'p': <alice_pubkey> 
      ],
      content: <base64 encoded transaction>,
   ]
   ```

   ```
   {
      id: <vtx4_hash>
      input: [
         <vtx2_hash>:0
      ]
      output: [
         { amount: 99989900 , script: "A + S | A + dT" }   // Alice change
         { amount: 10000 , script: "B + S | B + dT" }      // Bobs payment
         { amount: 100 , script: "S" }                     // ARK fee
      ]
      signatures: [
         A, S
      ] 
   }
   ```

6. Bob sees the transaction and issues a payment confirmation.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6665,
      "tags": [
         'e': <payment_offer_id>
         'e': <transaction_confirmation_id>
         'p': <alice_pubkey> 
      ],
      content: {}
   ]
   ```

#### Scenario 2 - Freddy joins the Ark.

1. Freddy commit the following transaction on chain.

   ```
   {
      id: <ark_round_1_extention>
      input: [
         <1BTC>
      ]
      output: [
         { amount: 100000000, script: "F + S | F + dT" }   // Freddy change
      ]
      signatures: [
         F
      ] 
   }
   ```

   Freddy sends a round amendment request to ASP.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6665,
      "tags": [
         'I': <txid>,
         's': <spent_utxo>
         'e': <payment_offer_id>
         'p': <ark_pubkey> 
      ],
      content: <base64 encoded transaction>,
   ]
   ```

   ASP sends out an ArkRoundAmendment

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6666,
      "tags": [
         'I': <txid>,
         's': <spent_utxo>
         'e': <payment_offer_id>
         'p': <ark_pubkey> 
      ],
      content: <base64 encoded transaction>,
   ]
   ```

#### Scenario 3 - Clare exits 0.3 BTC from the Ark.

Clare sends a on-chain Payment request

   ```
   {
      id: <vtx6_hash>
      input: [
         <vtx3_hash>:0
      ]
      output: [
         { amount: 30010000, script: "S + H | C + dT + T=800" }   // Payout + fee   
         { amount: 69990000, script: "C + S | C + dT" }           // Clares change
      ]
      signatures: [
         C
      ] 
   }
   ```

ARK sends a reply activating the VUTXO, he then commits an on-chain transaction.

   ```
   {
      id: <vtx6_hash>
      input: [
         <vtx3_hash>:0
      ]
      output: [
         { amount: 30010000, script: "S + H | C + dT + T=800"}   // Payout + fee   
         { amount: 69990000, script: "C + S | C + dT" }           // Clares change
      ]
      signatures: [
         C, S
      ] 
   }
   ```

   ```
   {
      id: <otx2_hash>
      input: [
         <otx1_hash>:0
      ]
      output: [
         { amount: 30000000, script: "C + H" | S + T=750" }       // Confirmed Payout   
         { amount: 69990000, script: "S" }                        // Arks change
      ]
      signatures: [
         S
      ] 
   }
   ```

Clare retrieves the on-chain transaction revealing H to ARK, activating the x-atomic swap.

   ```
   {
      id: <otx3_hash>
      input: [
         <otx2_hash>:0
      ]
      output: [
         { amount: 30010000, script: "C" }                         // Confirmed Payout   
      ]
      signatures: [
         C + H
      ] 
   }
   ```

Clare then sends out a forfeit transaction.

   ```
   {
      id: <vtx7_hash>
      input: [
         <vtx6_hash>:0
      ]
      output: [
         { amount: 30 010 000, script: "S"}                         // Payout + fee   
      ]
      signatures: [
         C
      ] 
   }
   ```

#### Scenario 4 - Alice buys a pair of shoes from Eve.

#### Scenario 5 - Wonderland Ark starts a new round financing it with external capital and rescycles the old.

At time T=900 ARK Provider sends out a Round Refresh Event with a timeout of 10 blocks. During this time, the
participants that want to participate in the next round need to announce their intention to do so.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6667,
      "tags": [
         'e': <round_start_event>
         'p': <alice_npub>
         ...
         'p': <freddy_npub>
      ],
      content: {
         new_round_seq: 2,             // New sequense number for the round
         new_round_end: 2000,          // The end of the new round
         round_end: 1000,              // Closing of the current round
         round_stop: 950,              // Cutoff time for the current round
         delta_time: 100,              // Time to use in delta transactions
         lock_key: <pubkey for locks>
      },
   ]
   ```

The participants reply to this event with Refresh Request Event.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6668,
      "tags": [
         'e': <round_refresh_event>
      ],
      content: [{                         // List of refresh requests
         exited [ <UTXO1>, ... ],         // The UTXOs of the funds to be exitd
         refreshed [ <UTXO1>, ... ],      // The UTXO of the funds to be refreshed
         sources [{
            txid: <txid>,
            seq: <seq>,
         }],         
      }, ... ],
   ]
   ```

Once the timeout hits, S goes over the events and builds a new round foundation tree, and sends out the new VTXO:s for
signing, he also builds a forfeit tree, and then sends out a RefreshSignatureRequestEvent to each participant.

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6669,
      "tags": [
         'e': <round_refresh_event>
      ],
      content: {
         root:  <transaction>,            // The root transaction to be signed
         nodes: [ <transaction>, ... ],   // The off-chain transactions to be signed
         forfit: [ <transaction>, ... ],  // The forfit transactions to be signed         
      },
   ]
   ```

The participants return the signatures. 

   ```
   [
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6670,
      "tags": [
         'e': <round_refresh_event>
      ],
      content: {
         <txid>:  <signature>,            // The root transaction to be signed
      },
   ]
   ```

S publishes the new root of the foundation tree on chain, and initiates the new round with a round start message.

   ```
   [g
      "id": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded sha256 of the serialized event data>,
      "pubkey": <32-bytes lowercase hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      "created_at": <unix timestamp in seconds>,
      "kind": 6660,
      "tags": [
         'e': <previos round start>,
         'p': <alice_npub>
         ...
         'p': <freddy_npub>

      ],
      content: {},
   ]
   ```


#### Scenario 6 - Bob subscribes to a subscription service.

#### Scenario 7 - Clare buys an episode from the Wonderland Gazette for 1000 sats.

### Storm cloud examples

#### Scenario 1 - Queen of Hearts colludes with Royal ARK tries to scam Alice with a double spend, gets detected and license terminated, Alice is reimbursed.

### Dark pattern

#### Scenario 1 - A totally corrupt ARK with corrupt users that are created by the ARK with an intent to defraud.
